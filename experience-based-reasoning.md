# Experience-Based Reasoning vs. Retrieval and Memory Approaches

Experience-based reasoning differs fundamentally from common approaches such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational memory mechanisms. RAG systems extend large language models by retrieving externally stored documents or factual content relevant to a query. While effective for improving factual accuracy and knowledge coverage, RAG primarily operates at the level of *information retrieval*. Retrieved materials remain unstructured with respect to lived context, emotional significance, or personal perspective. As a result, responses may be accurate yet still feel generic or detached from an individual’s experience.

Conversational memory mechanisms, by contrast, preserve fragments of prior interactions across sessions. These approaches typically store summaries, embeddings, or conversation history to maintain continuity. However, such memory is usually chronological and passive. It does not distinguish which past experiences are meaningful, nor does it encode relationships between experiences beyond temporal order.

Experience-based reasoning introduces a different abstraction. Rather than retrieving documents or replaying interaction history, it models *experience itself* as a structured reasoning unit. Experiences are represented as contextual nodes that include situational meaning, perspective, and implicit judgment. Relationships between experiences reflect relevance, similarity, or contrast, rather than simple recency.

In this framework, reasoning occurs prior to language generation. The system first selects and weighs relevant experiences, then generates responses grounded in experiential context. Language becomes an expressive layer, not the primary reasoning substrate. This distinction allows experience-based reasoning to support responses that reflect personal context and lived understanding, rather than relying solely on generalized patterns or retrieved content.
